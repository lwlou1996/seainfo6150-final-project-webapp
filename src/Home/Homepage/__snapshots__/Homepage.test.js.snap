                Over the last few years Netflix has been developing a mobile app called Prodicle to innovate in the physical production of TV shows and movies. The world of physical production is fast-paced, and needs vary significantly between the country, region, and even from one production to the next. The nature of the work means we’re developing write-heavy software, in a distributed environment, on devices where less than ⅓ of our users have very reliable connectivity whilst on set, and with a limited margin for error. For these reasons, as a small engineering team, we’ve found that optimizing for reliability and speed of product delivery is required for us to serve our evolving customers’ needs successfully.

                Netflix is known for its loosely coupled and highly scalable microservice architecture. Independent services allow for evolving at different paces and scaling independently. Yet they add complexity for use cases that span multiple services. Rather than exposing 100s of microservices to UI developers, Netflix offers a unified API aggregation layer at the edge.

                Google’s Memorystore service provides a fully managed Redis environment. Cloud Run provides a fully managed container hosting environment with automatic scaling. This opens up the opportunity to design solutions hosted by Cloud Run that leverage the services of Memorystore. In this article we will examine what is involved to set that up.

                In this article, I take a deep-dive into the world of WebsSockets, looking at the history of HTTP and the web and the use of WebSockets on the modern Web. I also list 16 steps to building your own real-time chat application, allowing you to gain hands-on experience with this powerful technology. I highly encourage that those with a basic grasp of web development take 20 minutes to follow along. The project uses Node.js, some vanilla JavaScript and a pre-built front-end. https://medium.com/@jamesbrown5292/what-i-learned-about-websockets-by-building-a-real-time-chat-application-using-socket-io-3d9e163e504

                At Compass, we can fetch listing data by either loading records with specific identifiers or searching for records that match a query. So what do we do when an external service tightly couples these paths that should operate independently of one another? Unnecessary bottlenecks, resource depletion, and down times. All in all, not a good look. But, let’s find a solution with the help of the Kardashians.https://medium.com/compass-true-north/how-to-alleviate-single-points-of-failure-in-a-critical-service-featuring-the-kardashians-f51d69dc6841

Serving more than 18 million requests per day, in 10,000+ cities, has enabled people to move freely and to think broadly while earning a livelihood on it. As one of the underlying engines, Uber Money fulfills some of the most important aspects of people’s engagement in the Uber experience. A system like this should not only be robust, but should also be highly available with zero-tolerance to downtime, after our success mantra: “To collect and disburse on-time, accurately and in-compliance”.https://eng.uber.com/money-scale-strong-data/

                Fraud has a direct impact on Uber as well as user experiences on the platform. To combat bad actors,  Uber has a dedicated team of anti-fraud analysts, data scientists, and UX experts who work collaboratively on this issue. As part of this effort, we build internal services that help us continually monitor and respond to changes in the ever-evolving fraud landscape.https://eng.uber.com/advanced-technologies-detecting-preventing-fraud-uber/

                The goal of my internship project was to create a structured way to evaluate machine learning/data science project ideas. I created a machine learning project template to help Concur Labs to prioritize and evaluate the existing as well as potential ML projects. The target users of this ML project template are all the ML project stakeholders, residents of Concur Labs’ internal residency program, and Concur employees who have an ML project idea.https://blog.concurlabs.com/labs-interns-machine-learning-project-template-8ec9913c892

                If you’ve been building web services on GCP Cloud Functions or Cloud Run, then you might have noticed that Google Cloud has been missing an important piece of infrastructure: an API Gateway.https://didil.medium.com/gcp-api-gateway-demo-with-terraform-go-cloud-run-f76148328e06
